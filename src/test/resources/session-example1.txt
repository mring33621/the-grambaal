Can you write me a Java container object with a read lock and a write lock? The container should be generic and contain at most 1 item. Setting or getting the contained object should use the appropriate lock.

Sure, here's an example of a Java container object with a read lock and a write lock using `ReentrantReadWriteLock`. The `ReentrantReadWriteLock` splits the lock into `ReadLock` and `WriteLock`, allowing multiple threads to read concurrently, with one thread writing.

```java
import java.util.concurrent.locks.ReentrantReadWriteLock;
import java.util.concurrent.locks.Lock;

public class Container<T> {
    private final ReentrantReadWriteLock lock = new ReentrantReadWriteLock();
    private final Lock readLock = lock.readLock();
    private final Lock writeLock = lock.writeLock();
    private T content;

    public T get() {
        readLock.lock();
        try {
            return content;
        } finally {
            readLock.unlock();
        }
    }

    public void set(T content) {
        writeLock.lock();
        try {
            this.content = content;
        } finally {
            writeLock.unlock();
        }
    }

    public boolean isEmpty() {
        readLock.lock();
        try {
            return content == null;
        } finally {
            readLock.unlock();
        }
    }
}
```

In this class `Container`, the methods `set` and `get` are locked by the write lock and the read lock respectively.

This setup guarantees that when one thread is setting the item using the `set` method, no other thread can either get or set until the `set` operation is completed. However, multiple threads can get the item concurrently using the `get` method. The `isEmpty` method uses the `readLock` because it doesn't change the state of the object and should not block the `set` method.

Thank you! Now, how would you change this code to contain at most 2 items?

<assistant_response model="gpt-4" timestamp="2024-02-10T12:44:46.8376755">
To contain at most two items, you could simply change the `content` instance from a single item to a `List<T>` with a maximum size of 2. Here is how you can do this:

```java
import java.util.LinkedList;
import java.util.List;
import java.util.concurrent.locks.ReentrantReadWriteLock;
import java.util.concurrent.locks.Lock;

public class Container<T> {
    private final ReentrantReadWriteLock lock = new ReentrantReadWriteLock();
    private final Lock readLock = lock.readLock();
    private final Lock writeLock = lock.writeLock();
    private final List<T> content = new LinkedList<>();

    public T get(int index) {
        readLock.lock();
        try {
            return content.get(index);
        } finally {
            readLock.unlock();
        }
    }

    public void set(T item) {
        writeLock.lock();
        try {
            if (content.size() == 2) {
                content.remove(0);
            }
            content.add(item);
        } finally {
            writeLock.unlock();
        }
    }

    public boolean isEmpty() {
        readLock.lock();
        try {
            return content.isEmpty();
        } finally {
            readLock.unlock();
        }
    }
}
```

In this new `Container` class, the `get` method now takes an index parameter which designates which item in the list to retrieve. The `set` method removes the first item from the list if the size of the list is already 2 before adding a new item, ensuring the size of the list never exceeds 2.

The `isEmpty` method returns `true` if the list is empty and `false` otherwise.
